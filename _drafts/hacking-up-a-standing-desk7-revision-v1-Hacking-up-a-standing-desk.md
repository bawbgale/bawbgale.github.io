For me, the key to workplace comfort is changing it up &#8212; sitting for a while, standing for a while, taking a break and going for a walk&#8230;. So I found an inexpensive way to turn my desk at GameHouse into a standing workstation.

I was inspired by [this design on ikeahackers.net](http://www.ikeahackers.net/2012/07/on-off-standing-desk-lack-desk-add-on.html), which a few others in the office have built, but I wanted to have a larger surface for my laptop, external monitor, coffee cup, etc. So I used the [coffee table version of the Lack series](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10104295/) ($20 new but I found one for $8 on Craigslist), figured out my preferred height, then cut the legs to fit. I didn&#8217;t have the right tools to make nice even cuts, so I took it to [NE Seattle Tool Library](http://neseattletoollibrary.org/) and used their chop saw.

So now I can just put the table on half of my L-shaped desk and have sitting or standing options at all times.
