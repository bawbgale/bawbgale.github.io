I came up with an interview question for our data engineer candidates that tries to reveal how they think about juggle priorities. Definitely meant to be a no-right-answer Kobayashi Maru question.

Hypothetic priority juggling interview question

You are nearing the end of your workday and need to decide what to work on next. You have four possible next tasks. Each will take approximately the same amount of time to complete:

A. Investigate and reply to a question from your boss who is currently on a plane that will land after you go home.

B. Finish a medium priority task that you started this morning and committed to competing by end of day.

C. Help another team member who is struggling with a high priority project due this week.

D. Begin designing a solution for a vaguely defined high priority project that absolutely must be done next week.

What do you do?

If it&#8217;s not obvious already, each emphasizes a different dimension:  
A managing up, plus they can&#8217;t cop out and ask for their boss to choose the priority.  
B commitment, throughput, getting things done  
C team collaboration, not blocking others  
D reducing risk, short vs long term planning
