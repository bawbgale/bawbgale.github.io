Way back when I worked in the newspaper industry, I got to participate in the transition from laying out pages with x-acto knives and glue to desktop publishing. The old method was called &#8220;cold type&#8221; because it replaced something called &#8220;hot type&#8221; that I never got to see. This video shows what an amazing feat of mechanical engineering those hot type machines were! Anyone raised in the 21st century can hardly imagine operating such a device without computers, let alone designing one!

I&#8217;m not sure when this movie was produced but I&#8217;m guessing in the 1940s. At the end, you get a glimpse of the digital revolution yet to come, but with punched tape instead of electronics. You can also see why these &#8220;back shop&#8221; jobs were union. Don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s just a bucket of molten lead inches away from the keyboard!
