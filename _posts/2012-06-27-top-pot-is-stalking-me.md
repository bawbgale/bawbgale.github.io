My job at Intersect had the major perk of being on the same block as Top Pot’s Belltown cafe. Yum!

Then they opened a shop in Wedgwood, about a mile from my house. Hot damn! Doughnuts coming and going!

It’s been 18 months since I moved to a new job, and look! New Top Pots opening next to my office in South Lake Union AND near the downtown Y, where I exercise. The doughnuts! They’re following me! How can I resist. They want me as much as I want them. I’ve become some kind of doughnut shop indicator species.
