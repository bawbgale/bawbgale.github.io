What? Bob, how could you say such a thing about that ugly monstrosity? They tore down a beautiful old hotel to build it, an event that so horrified Seattle that it kicked off the preservation movement that led to the protection of Pioneer Square.

Why, because it’s such an perfect symbol of that very struggle — a ship ripping through the fabric of the city, pointed right at its historical center. And not just any ship, a ship carrying cars! Brilliant.

I’m not saying we should never tear down old stuff to build new stuff. Just that history is important — history that you can live in and touch — and we can easily lose it in the busy business of our daily lives. The sinking ship is now part of history too.

Plus, now that it’s built, why waste it? That would also be short-sighted.

BTW, legend has it the lot is cursed. Here’s a [Danny Westneat column about its colorful history](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/dannywestneat/2011277009_danny07.html).
